Agile vs DevOps: The Benefits, Similarities, and Differences
Fundamentally, DevOps brings together two large siloed teams together to allow for quicker software releases while Agile is focused on getting smaller teams to collaborate with each other so it can react quickly to the ever-changing consumer needs.

Davy Hua, Head of DevOps at Santa Clara CA.-based Shiftleft, explained how both Agile and DevOps are managed. “Agile employs sprints, [which] range from a week to [months] as a way to manage development schedule while DevOps focuses on hyper-releases starting with several per day,” Hua said.

Both DevOps and Agile can work in tandem since they can complement each other. DevOps promotes a fully automated continuous integration and deployment pipeline to enable frequent releases, while Agile provides the ability to rapidly adapt to the changing requirements and better collaboration between different smaller teams.

Michael Mazyar, CTO at Cary NC.-based Samanage, further elaborated on the “mutual benefits” of both DevOps and Agile. “When applied in tandem, Agile and DevOps can enable organizations to develop and implement technology with significantly greater speed. [Plus], there’s an emphasis on putting customer needs at the forefront of whatever technology it is you are developing, [along with an] understanding [of] how the software is being used, and [how it should be improved].”

That said, the potential drawbacks that face both DevOps and Agile are rooted in the “significant cultural shift” they both require. DevOps requires two siloed teams to nurture a relationship to work together, and Agile requires organizations to move away from a conventional static work environment.

Mayzar highlighted that these potential challenges are likely to be imminent in larger organizations. “Within an organization, particularly larger organizations, different teams are likely to have their habits of focusing solely on departmental goals ingrained in their way of thinking. It’s essential to have the appropriate resources and stakeholder buy-in for both approaches.”

On an individual basis, Singaraju explained that Agile has many advantages over the conventional waterfall model but does come with some certain challenges, especially for larger teams. “Agile has various advantages [including] user-focused development, increased team collaboration, fast product delivery, and flexibility. However, it does come with some challenges such as uncertainty of end goal, and making it work right for large teams.”

As for DevOps, Singaraju commented on how it can accelerate product innovation, but if not executed properly it can cause a burden. “DevOps [enables] better quality, performance, and accelerated product innovation.
